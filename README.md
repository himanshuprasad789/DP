these are the practice questions done while learning dynamic programming-

how to think:-
1. Make the Code run using basic recursion
2. Optimise the code i.e. then use memoization to store data and fetch it so that we dont perform recursion for the already solved sub-problems.


it's best to make tree like structure on a piece of paper and find the patterns
then make the base cases
pass memo object into the function
make the base case for the memo obj i.e. to check if that sub-problem exist in memo obj or not
